A rule based proxy forwarder on iPhone and iPad. 

**This is Deprecated!**
I'm working on a new app based on the new API from Network Extension. However, it requires user having entitlements, which means you can not use it on you phone unless you:

1. have a develper account.
2. get entitlements from Apple.

Soca still works anyway (with minor revision to support Swift 2).
